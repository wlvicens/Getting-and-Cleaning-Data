Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

This repository was created as part of the course project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The included run_analysis.R script reads the raw data files from UCI's Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and writes a new, tidy data set that summarizes the mean values for all mean and std variables by Activity and Subject. To run this script, the working directory must be set to the root directory of the unzipped HAR data set.
